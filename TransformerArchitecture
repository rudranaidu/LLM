Understanding Transformer Architecture in Simple Terms
The transformer architecture is a foundational building block for modern Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT and LLaMA. It revolutionized natural language processing by introducing mechanisms like multi-head attention and positional encoding. Here's an explanation based on the provided notes:

Transformers: Encoders + Decoders
The transformer model consists of two main components:

Encoders ‚Äì Process the input data to extract meaningful features.
Decoders ‚Äì Generate output based on the processed input from the encoder.
While some models use both encoders and decoders (e.g., for translation tasks), others like GPT primarily focus on decoders to generate text.

Vectors in Transformers
Transformers process text as numerical representations called vectors. Here's how it works:

Every word or query is broken into smaller units called tokens.
Each token is converted into a vector‚Äîa multi-dimensional numerical representation.
Vectors capture relationships between words. For instance:

"King - Man + Woman = Queen"
"Smallest - Small + Big = Biggest"
These relationships are learned by the model during training. However, biases in data can be reflected in vector relationships, e.g., "Doctor - Man + Woman = Nurse." Early GPT models carried forward such biases, but models like LLaMA improved by using feedback loops to mitigate them.

Dimensionality of Vectors
Vector dimensions determine the complexity of word representations:

Early models like word2vec (introduced by Google in 2013) used 512 dimensions.
GPT-3, a much larger model, operates with over 12,288 dimensions.
Positional Encoding (PE)
Transformers use Positional Encoding to understand the order of words in a sentence. Since the model itself doesn't have a natural sense of sequence, positional information is added to the token vectors. This is done using sine and cosine waves to create a unique positional vector, which is distinct from the embedding vector.

Context Embedding (CE)
Understanding the context of a word is crucial for correct meaning:

Example:
"I went to the bank to deposit money" (financial institution)
"I went for a walk on the river bank" (river's edge)
The context embedding ensures that the vector representation adapts to the surrounding words, adding contextual flavor to positional information.

The Attention Mechanism
The heart of the transformer is the attention mechanism, which assigns importance to different words in the input based on their relevance. The Multi-Head Attention (MHA) mechanism allows the model to focus on multiple parts of the input simultaneously. Each layer of the model has the following key components:

Feedforward Network
Multi-Head Attention
How Attention Works (QKV)
Every vector in the transformer contains three components:

Query (Q) ‚Äì Represents the current word.
Key (K) ‚Äì Represents related words.
Value (V) ‚Äì Represents the importance of those words.
The attention process involves:

Scaled Dot Product: The dot product of Q and K matrices determines word similarity, scaled by the square root of the dimension d.
Softmax Layer: Normalizes the scores to create weights.
Attention Output: Multiplies the weights with the V matrix.
The formula is:

Attention(Q,K,V) = softmax(Q K^T/sqrt d) V

Multi-Head Attention
Instead of calculating attention once, multi-head attention performs multiple parallel attention calculations (heads). The results are concatenated to enrich the representation.
The final output is:

MultiHead
(ùëÑ,ùêæ,ùëâ)= Concat(head1,head2,‚Ä¶,headùëõ)
MultiHead(Q,K,V)=Concat(head 1‚Äã,head 2 ,‚Ä¶,headn)

Layers in GPT Models
GPT-3 has 96 layers.
Each layer enriches the word representations through combinations of attention and feedforward networks.
Words pass through all 96 layers, and their representations are refined with each step. The model considers 96 √ó 96 combinations of words, creating a deeply contextual understanding.
Why Transformers Are Better than LSTMs
Parallelization: Transformers process input sequences simultaneously, unlike LSTMs, which process sequentially. This makes them faster and more scalable.
Contextual Understanding: Transformers use attention mechanisms to focus on relevant parts of the input, providing a richer context than LSTMs.
Positional Embedding: LSTMs rely on inherent sequence processing, but transformers explicitly encode positional information, improving flexibility.
In summary, the transformer architecture is a blend of contextual embedding, positional encoding, multi-head attention, and deep layers, making it powerful for tasks like text generation and understanding.
