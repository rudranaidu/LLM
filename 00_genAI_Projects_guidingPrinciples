Following are guiding principles for creating or learning projects in AI.

Choice of Problems ‚Äì Preference for meaningful or frontier problems over generic use cases.
Demonstrated Obsession ‚Äì Evidence of deep personal drive through self-driven projects, not just checkboxes.
Unique, Quirky Passions ‚Äì Tangible individuality and curiosity that bring novelty to their work.

While practicing also I need to practice or learn by keeping those points in the mind
today I wanted to start creating a project called travel planner . The aim of this project is 
"I want a 5-day trip. Plan flights, hotels, and sightseeing." 

Finally I will ask you to showcase our project as per our guiding principles.
next 3 days I wanted to master Agentic architecture by learning different protocols also


That‚Äôs a powerful foundation ‚Äî your knowledge of **Transformer architectures, LLM training, RAG, VectorDBs, Agents, and LangChain** gives you all the tools to **build standout projects** that resonate with the **LinkedIn post's 3 high-signal filters**:

Let‚Äôs design **5 standout projects** that:

* Are **non-generic**
* Showcase **depth and obsession**
* Reflect **quirky originality**

* Can complement or evolve your existing **Upgrade Assistant**

## ‚úÖ Project 1: **Upgrade Assistant 2.0 ‚Äì Self-Healing Debug Assistant for Legacy Systems**

> **Retrofitting your current project**

### ‚ú® Showcase Angle:

> ‚ÄúBuilt a self-healing assistant that analyzes logs, workflows, and prior outages to auto-suggest fixes and simulate patch deployments in enterprise BI systems.‚Äù

### üîç LinkedIn Filters:

* **Choice of problem**: Legacy systems + AI = real-world pain.
* **Obsession**: Added patch simulation, log pattern clustering, multi-agent collaboration (e.g., patch agent, log reader agent, escalation agent).
* **Quirky passion**: Turned obscure one-off patches into a smart troubleshooting interface.

### üõ†Ô∏è Add-ons:

* Graph-based workflow visualization with `networkx` or `cytoscape`.
* ‚ÄúReplay‚Äù past incidents using RAG + agent memory.
* Add OCI-compatible LLM deployment YAML to make it production-ready.

## ‚úÖ Project 2: **AutoPromptGym ‚Äì Evolve the Best Prompt via Reinforcement + Evolution**

> **LLM x RL x Evolutionary Techniques in action**

### ‚ú® Showcase Angle:

> ‚ÄúBuilt an environment to evolve the best prompts for LLMs using genetic algorithms + reinforcement rewards on task accuracy.‚Äù

### üîç LinkedIn Filters:

* **Choice of problem**: Improving prompt engineering in a non-manual way.
* **Obsession**: Combined OpenAI/Mistral with PPO or evolution strategy to optimize prompts across thousands of runs.
* **Quirky passion**: Let prompts evolve like digital organisms.

### üõ†Ô∏è Add-ons:

* Include visualization of evolution over generations.
* Support for pluggable tasks (e.g., QA, summarization, code gen).

## ‚úÖ Project 3: **MythWeaver ‚Äì Generate Folklore from Any Culture Using Retrieval + LLMs**

> **RAG + LLM Creativity**

### ‚ú® Showcase Angle:

> ‚ÄúBuilt a folklore generator that retrieves authentic cultural myths using RAG and weaves original stories in that style using LLMs.‚Äù

### üîç LinkedIn Filters:

* **Choice of problem**: Culturally rich + educational + creative.
* **Obsession**: Collected structured data from folk archives, built prompt chains to match tone/style/structure.
* **Quirky passion**: Mixed AI with mythology and storytelling.

### üõ†Ô∏è Add-ons:

* Slider to switch between realism vs. fantasy.
* Option to generate illustrations using DALL¬∑E or SDXL.

---

## ‚úÖ Project 4: **AgentChef ‚Äì Kitchen Bot that Plans Meals, Shops Ingredients, and Explains Science**

> **Multi-agent coordination project with a fun twist**

### ‚ú® Showcase Angle:

> ‚ÄúCreated an LLM-based chef assistant that plans meals based on constraints (budget, diet, cuisine), coordinates agents to fetch prices, recommend recipes, and explain the science behind each dish.‚Äù

### üîç LinkedIn Filters:

* **Choice of problem**: Real-world + niche AI use.
* **Obsession**: Combined agents for planning, shopping, nutrition.
* **Quirky passion**: Explaining the chemical reactions in cooking.

### üõ†Ô∏è Add-ons:

* Add a Streamlit interface with recipe cards.
* Show workflow trace for agent collaboration.

---

## ‚úÖ Project 5: **LLM Testbench ‚Äì Benchmark LLMs on Realistic Edge Cases (PDFs, Tables, OCR, Noisy Data)**

> **Benchmarking + tool dev project**

### ‚ú® Showcase Angle:

> ‚ÄúCreated a realistic testbench that breaks LLMs with real-world enterprise inputs: malformed PDFs, no headers, log corruption, table joins ‚Äî and visualizes model breakdowns.‚Äù

### üîç LinkedIn Filters:

* **Choice of problem**: Painfully real.
* **Obsession**: Created adversarial samples, stress-tested 5 open-source LLMs.
* **Quirky passion**: Built "break-your-model" challenge sets for AI nerds.

### üõ†Ô∏è Add-ons:

* Include metrics like retrieval accuracy, hallucination %, formatting robustness.
* Publish as an open-source benchmark on GitHub.
