9 Ways NOT to Use LLMs (And What to Do Instead) 

Most teams are making these critical mistakes when using LLMs—wasting money, getting unreliable outputs, and frustrating users. 

Don't let your AI-powered system fall into the same traps. 

Here’s what to avoid and how to fix it: 

1. Overusing Zero-Shot Prompts 
 ↳ Expecting perfect results from vague, contextless prompts leads to inconsistent, low-quality outputs. 
 ↳ Instead: Use few-shot prompting—provide clear examples to guide the model’s reasoning. 

2. Monolithic Prompting 
 ↳ Stuffing multiple complex tasks into a single overloaded prompt leads to confusion and incoherence. 
 ↳ Instead: Break tasks into logical sub-prompts to improve structure and clarity. 

3. Treating LLMs as Reliable Databases 
 ↳ LLMs don’t store facts—they generate responses based on probability. This leads to hallucinations and incorrect factual outputs. 
 ↳ Instead: Integrate external data sources (RAG, APIs, databases) for factual accuracy. 

4. Ignoring Latency
 ↳ If responses take too long without UI/UX feedback, users assume the system is broken and abandon the interaction. 
 ↳ Instead: Optimize retrieval, cache frequent results, and use loading indicators or streaming to keep users engaged. 

5. Overkill with Big Models 
 ↳ Using large, expensive models for trivial tasks leads to unnecessary cost & latency. 
 ↳ Instead: Use smaller, optimized models for simple queries and escalate only when needed. 

6. Misusing Temperature & Model Parameters 
 ↳ Setting temperature too high makes outputs random & inconsistent, while wrong token limits cut off responses. 
 ↳ Instead: Fine-tune parameters based on task needs—lower temperature for accuracy, higher for creativity. 

7. No Guardrails (Ignoring Safety) 
 ↳ Deploying without moderation, safety constraints, or prompt filtering leads to uncontrolled, risky outputs. 
 ↳ Instead: Implement moderation APIs, system prompts, and safety audits to enforce boundaries. 

8. Ignoring Feedback & Evaluation Loops 
 ↳ No feedback = no improvement. If you’re not capturing user feedback or tracking model performance, responses degrade over time. 
 ↳ Instead: Implement rating systems, correction mechanisms, and prompt evaluation metrics for continuous refinement. 

9. Expecting LLMs to Replace Logic 
 ↳ LLMs are not deterministic—they struggle with precise arithmetic, filtering, and complex logic. 
 ↳ Instead: Pair LLMs with explicit logic systems (backend rules, structured workflows, deterministic processing). 

Most AI failures don’t happen because the model is bad—they happen because of poor design choices.
