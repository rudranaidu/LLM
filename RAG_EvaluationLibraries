Open-Source RAG Evaluation Libraries
1️⃣ RAGAS 🚀
✅ Open-source (GitHub Repo)

Provides LLM-based metrics to evaluate retrieval relevance, answer correctness, and faithfulness.
Helps detect hallucinations in RAG-based models.
Built on Hugging Face, supports integration with LangChain.
2️⃣ DeepEval 🔍
✅ Open-source (GitHub Repo)

Unit testing framework for LLMs and RAG-based pipelines.
Includes predefined evaluation metrics like accuracy, coherence, and faithfulness.
Works with LangChain, OpenAI, and Hugging Face models.
3️⃣ TruLens 📊
✅ Open-source (GitHub Repo)

Provides real-time tracing and evaluation for LLM applications.
Evaluates retrieval relevance, response quality, and hallucination risks.
Integrates with LangChain, OpenAI, and vector databases.
4️⃣ Uptrain 📈
✅ Open-source (GitHub Repo)

Focuses on observability, monitoring, and debugging of LLM-based apps.
Provides custom evaluation metrics and anomaly detection.
Supports drift detection and continuous monitoring.
5️⃣ ARES (Automated Retrieval Evaluation System) 🛠️
✅ Open-source (GitHub Repo)

Measures retrieval precision, recall, and ranking quality.
Uses semantic similarity for document retrieval evaluation.
Designed for improving vector search strategies.
