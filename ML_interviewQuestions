Generative Adversial Network(GAN):
GAN is a class of machine learning frameworks  where two neural networks, the generator and the  discriminator,
contest with each other. The  generator creates fake data, while the  discriminator tries to distinguish it from real data. 

GANs were the dominant method for generating realistic images before diffusion models became popular.
After diffusion models arrived (around 2020–2021), they largely replaced GANs in high-end image generation
because they are more stable, scalable, and controllable — but GANs are still used in some niche areas like 
image-to-image translation, super-resolution, and cases where speed matters more than flexibility.

Conditional GANs(CGANs) : condition + GAN .. condition is used to generate the data.

Variational Auto Encoder (VAE):
A VAE is a type of autoencoder that learns to  encode data into a latent space and then decode it  
back to the original data space, with added  probabilistic elements to allow for more robust  data generation. 
It mainly uses in Diffustion models for compression and decompression.
