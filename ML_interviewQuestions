Generative Adversial Network(GAN):
GAN is a class of machine learning frameworks  where two neural networks, the generator and the  discriminator,
contest with each other. The  generator creates fake data, while the  discriminator tries to distinguish it from real data. 

GANs were the dominant method for generating realistic images before diffusion models became popular.
After diffusion models arrived (around 2020–2021), they largely replaced GANs in high-end image generation
because they are more stable, scalable, and controllable — but GANs are still used in some niche areas like 
image-to-image translation, super-resolution, and cases where speed matters more than flexibility.

Conditional GANs(CGANs) : condition + GAN .. condition is used to generate the data.

Variational Auto Encoder (VAE):
A VAE is a type of autoencoder that learns to  encode data into a latent space and then decode it  
back to the original data space, with added  probabilistic elements to allow for more robust  data generation. 
It mainly uses in Diffustion models for compression and decompression.

The GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer)  model is a type of Transformer model developed  by OpenAI, designed to
generate coherent and  contextually relevant text by pre-training on a  large corpus of text data. 

GPT-3 is an improved version of GPT-2 with  significantly more parameters (175 billion vs. 1.5  billion),
leading to better performance in  generating more accurate and contextually  relevant text. 

GPT-4 is 1.76 trillion parameters. Open AI officially didnt disclose it

GPT-5 is 80 trillion parameters.

Bias can be mitigated by using diverse and  representative training data, implementing  fairness constraints, 
and continuously monitoring  and updating models to reduce biased outputs.
