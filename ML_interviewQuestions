Generative Adversial Network(GAN):
GAN is a class of machine learning frameworks  where two neural networks, the generator and the  discriminator,
contest with each other. The  generator creates fake data, while the  discriminator tries to distinguish it from real data. 

GANs were the dominant method for generating realistic images before diffusion models became popular.
After diffusion models arrived (around 2020–2021), they largely replaced GANs in high-end image generation
because they are more stable, scalable, and controllable — but GANs are still used in some niche areas like 
image-to-image translation, super-resolution, and cases where speed matters more than flexibility.

Conditional GANs(CGANs) : condition + GAN .. condition is used to generate the data.

Variational Auto Encoder (VAE):
A VAE is a type of autoencoder that learns to  encode data into a latent space and then decode it  
back to the original data space, with added  probabilistic elements to allow for more robust  data generation. 
It mainly uses in Diffustion models for compression and decompression.

The GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer)  model is a type of Transformer model developed  by OpenAI, designed to
generate coherent and  contextually relevant text by pre-training on a  large corpus of text data. 

GPT-3 is an improved version of GPT-2 with  significantly more parameters (175 billion vs. 1.5  billion),
leading to better performance in  generating more accurate and contextually  relevant text. 

GPT-4 is 1.76 trillion parameters. Open AI officially didnt disclose it

GPT-5 is 80 trillion parameters.

Bias can be mitigated by using diverse and  representative training data, implementing  fairness constraints, 
and continuously monitoring  and updating models to reduce biased outputs. 

The latent space is an abstract space where  generative models, like VAEs and GANs, map input  data to a compressed representation. 
This space  allows for the generation of new data by sampling from it and decoding it back into the original data  domain.

How to validate Correctness of text generation. Following are different techniques

| **Metric**     | **What it Measures**                   | **When to Use**            | **Limitations**                                    |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
|   BLEU         | n-gram overlap with reference          | Translation, summarization | Ignores meaning, just word overlap                 |
|   ROUGE        | Overlap of recall-oriented n-grams     | Summarization              | Doesn’t check factual correctness                  |
|   METEOR       | Like BLEU but considers synonyms       | Translation                | Still reference-based                              |
|  BERTScore     | Semantic similarity using embeddings   | General text generation    | Needs reference text                               |
|  Perplexity    | How well model predicts the next token | Language modeling          | Lower is better, but doesn’t ensure quality output |
|  Distinct-n    | Diversity of n-grams                   | Chatbots, story gen        | Doesn’t check relevance                            |


How to validate correctness of Image generation:
The Inception Score is a metric used to evaluate  the quality of generated images by assessing 
how  closely the generated images resemble real  images and the diversity of the generated set. 

BERT VS GPT

BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from  Transformers) is a transformer model designed  for understanding and context in text,
using  bidirectional attention. GPT is focused on text  generation using unidirectional attention. 

SelfAttention:
Self-attention allows each token in the input  sequence to focus on different parts of the  sequence, 
enabling the model to capture  dependencies and relationships between tokens,  regardless of their distance from each other. 

FineTuning:
Fine-tuning involves taking a pre-trained language  model and training it further on a specific task or  
dataset to adapt it to particular requirements,  enhancing its performance on that task. 

Transfer Learning:
Transfer learning in generative models involves  pre-training on a large corpus of data to learn  general language patterns,
followed by fine-tuning  on a specific task or domain to improve  performance and relevance.

Reinforcement Learning:
Rewarding desirable outcomes and penalizing  undesirable ones, guiding the model to improve its  performance iteratively. 

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that can capture  
long-term dependencies and are commonly used in text generation tasks to handle sequential data.

Human feedback can be integrated using  techniques like reinforcement learning with  human feedback (RLHF), 
where human evaluators  provide feedback on generated content, guiding  the model to improve its outputs iteratively. 

The T5 (Text-To-Text Transfer Transformer) model  treats all NLP tasks as a text-to-text problem, converting  inputs to text and generating text outputs,
enabling it  to handle various tasks with a unified architecture. 

Positional encoding captures Order and relationships of tokens

Overfitting can be prevented using techniques  such as regularization (e.g., dropout, weight  decay),
early stopping, data augmentation, and  ensuring a diverse and representative training  dataset. 

Adversarial training involves training a model with  adversarial examples, which are deliberately  perturbed inputs designed to deceive the model. 
For generative models, it can enhance robustness  by improving their ability to handle variations and  adversarial attacks. 

Recurrent Generative VS FeedForward Generative Models:

Recurrent generative models, such as RNN-based  VAEs, generate data sequentially, maintaining a  hidden state that captures dependencies over  time.
Feedforward generative models, like GANs,  generate data in a single pass without temporal  dependencies.
