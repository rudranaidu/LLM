Getting started with AI Agents can be very overwhelming

Here's a simple guide to help you move faster....

If you checked my recent post on the CB Insights report,

2025 leads with major AI Agent investments.

So this is the right time to start learning more about them

Start with the fundamentals of Agent architectures and decision-making frameworks.

and understand the basics of LLMs and their role as the "brains" of your agents.

📌 Master the core components of Agent systems:

↳ Planning mechanisms
↳ Memory systems
↳ Tool use & function calling
↳ Add MCP to make the Tool use easier
↳ Environment interaction
↳ Multi-Agent collaboration
↳ Core agent orchestration
↳ Data Bias and Recovery
↳ Workflow Adaptation
↳ Evaluation and Tracing
↳ Finally, learn about compliance and ethnics in agents

📌 Learn about popular Agent frameworks:

↳ Google ADK Agents: https://lnkd.in/gvCS7S2s
↳ Microsoft Magentic-One: https://lnkd.in/gD5SYhj9
↳ LangChain Agents: https://lnkd.in/gFSUFynP
↳ Microsoft Semantic Kernel: https://lnkd.in/gXyXykhF
↳ IBM Bee: https://lnkd.in/gsSzsgai
↳ OpenAI Agent SDK: https://lnkd.in/giafrGBX
↳ CrewAI: https://learn.crewai.com/
↳ Pydantic Agents: https://lnkd.in/gz-egBv4

Not an exhaustive list, but it will surely help you move faster.

📌 Start building! Begin with simple task-specific agents, then work your way up to autonomous systems that can:

↳ Chain multiple tools together
↳ Maintain long-term memory
↳ Self-improve through feedback
↳ Collaborate with other agents
↳ Generates accurate agentic responses

📌 You can also utilise a few well-known coding agents to build faster

↳ Cursor AI: https://www.cursor.com/
↳ Windsurf: https://lnkd.in/gGMeHsm6
↳ Claude Code: https://lnkd.in/g2pmqcUm
↳ OpenAI Codex: https://lnkd.in/gmw9mTcc

📌 Utilise protocols to scale your agentic systems

↳ MCP: https://lnkd.in/g586baCv
↳ A2A: https://lnkd.in/gT-cCbX9
↳ ANP: https://lnkd.in/g5RnZtB9
↳ ACP: https://lnkd.in/gfcjQnXU
↳ AGORA: https://lnkd.in/g7qvtYhP

Just to name a few.

To emphasise 🎯

AI Agent investments are climbing steadily, growing each week, and you don't want to miss out on this wave this time.

If you want a learning roadmap, you can check out my recent roadmap pinned in the comments.

If you are a business leader, we've developed frameworks that cut through the hype, including our five-level Agentic AI Progression Framework to evaluate any agent's capabilities in my latest book.
