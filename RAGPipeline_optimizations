1. PDF Parsing Optimization
Use a structured parser: Since your PDFs contain both text and tables, ensure that PDFPlumber extracts tables correctly and maintains associations between columns.
Extract hyperlinks: Identify hyperlinks in your PDFs and store them separately for easy retrieval.
Normalize extracted data: Convert extracted tables into structured JSON format for better indexing.

2. Data Organization & Storage
Column Linking: Ensure that when one column (e.g., bug number) is queried, the pipeline retrieves all relevant columns (workarounds, JCs, hyperlinks).
Metadata tagging: Use additional metadata like column headers, keywords, and embeddings to improve search quality in ChromaDB.

3. Vector Database Enhancements
Chunking Strategy: Optimize how text and tables are chunked. Try:
Storing each table row as a single document.
Keeping text-based explanations together.
Using overlapping chunks to preserve context.
Embeddings & Indexing:
Experiment with different embedding models to improve similarity search.
Use hierarchical indexing (text, tables, metadata) to enable better retrieval.

4. Prompt Optimization
System Prompt Refinement: Ensure the system prompt clearly instructs the LLM to focus only on retrieved results.
Dynamic Prompting: Modify the query dynamically based on user intent (e.g., if the query is about a bug number, the system should retrieve the full row).
Query Expansion: Rephrase or enrich user queries to improve retrieval.
                                                                      
5. LLM Response Control
Filter Irrelevant Answers: Post-process LLM responses to ensure only relevant information is returned.
RAG Evaluation Metrics: Implement a feedback loop where incorrect answers are analyzed, and retrieval logic is adjusted accordingly.
Fine-tuning Considerations: If accuracy does not improve significantly, consider fine-tuning the LLM on your dataset.
