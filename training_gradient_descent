During training, the model suffers from the vanishing gradient problem in deeper layers

Vanishing Gradient Problem:

    When training deep neural networks using backpropagation, the gradient (i.e., error signal) becomes very small (or "vanishes") as it is propagated backwards through many layers.
    This leads to very slow or no learning in early layers.
    
Real-world analogy:
Imagine you're whispering a message through a chain of 20 people. By the time it gets to the first person, the message is inaudible or distorted.

Transformers are deep models built using multi-layered encoder and/or decoder blocks. Each block processes data and passes it forward.
Because Transformers can go very deep (sometimes 48+ layers!), gradient flow is crucial during backpropagation.

Residual Connections provide shortcuts for gradient flow.


Residual Connections:
Introduced in ResNet (Residual Networks) and adopted in Transformers.

Instead of passing the output of each layer as-is to the next, residual connections add the input to the output of that layer:

Output=Layer(x)+x

This provides a shortcut (or skip connection) for the gradient to flow directly back, avoiding the full depth of the network.

🧠 Why it helps:
Gradient has a path to flow backwards more easily, without being squashed by many layers.

Think of it like building express lanes in a city — traffic (i.e., gradients) can still flow when regular roads (deep layers) are congested
