Here’s a suggested step-by-step path:

✅ Level 1: Basics
Understand what weights and biases are in linear regression.
Learn about loss functions and backpropagation.

✅ Level 2: Neural Networks
Study multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs)
See how weights are updated through layers.

✅ Level 3: Word Embeddings
Understand how text is converted to vectors (word2vec, embedding layers)

✅ Level 4: Transformers
Learn about attention, queries, keys, values — and their weights

Study how weights are used in self-attention and feedforward layers

✅ Level 5: Training LLMs
Understand the optimization process

Learn about weight initialization, learning rate, gradient descent, etc.
